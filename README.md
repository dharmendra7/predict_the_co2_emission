# predict_the_co2_emission

Implemented Simple linear regression. I have downloaded a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, splited data into training and test sets, created a model using training set, evaluated the model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value.(


Implemented Multiple linear regression. I again use the Carbon dioxide emission dataset to build a model, Evaluate the model, and finally use model to predict unknown value. [MLR_co2emission.ipynb](https://github.com/dharmendra7/predict_the_co2_emission/blob/main/MLR_co2emission.ipynb)
